# **M**ulti **P**roxy to serve the plugins for discord client mods, idk

### Description
- Includes discord mobile client mod plugins with their own respective folders.

### [Angel](https://github.com/Angelix1/MP/tree/master/angel)
- This is mostly a plugin i made for my own QOL, it often follows what client mod i use (currenty, using vendetta under the hood)

### PyonCord (old name Bunny)
- There's none still, because there's it's still in-dev

### Unbound (Enmity v3)
- There's none still, because there's it's still in-dev _(possibly not available to android as client mod, but who knows, theys said, they'll will support android)_

### [Vendetta (EOL)](https://github.com/Angelix1/MP/tree/master/vendetta)
- Anything inside this folder, won't be build, it exist as archive.
